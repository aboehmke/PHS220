% Game of Life

%{ the world consists of an LxL matrix
a cell in the world is an element of the matrix
a cell at a time can have one of two states, alive or dead
at each discrete time step, the state of all cells are updated simultaneously
the next state of each cell depends on 
its current state and on  
the current states of its 8 neighbors according to 3 rules:
if a cell is alive and has >= 2 living neighbors, it stays alive
if a cell is dead and has exactly 3 living neighbors, it becomes alive
if a cell is alive and has <= 1 living neighbors, it dies
